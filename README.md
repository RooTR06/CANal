# CANal

If I ever find time and willingness with some motiviation, when it finished, one day, some time I hope, it will handle the Rx/Tx raw CAN Data.

It will be handlibg the Rx/Tx operations for raw CAN data, Debugging, visulazing, saving and various handling operations. 

Now all it does is just cleaning the CAN data which I wrote it in my phone while I was waiting my gf at the bus terminal because I was bored.
